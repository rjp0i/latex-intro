\section{First Figure}

Here is a figure, with no caption
\medskip

{\bf Your Turn: Try changing the width of the figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering   %centers the figure (horizontally) on the page
\includegraphics[width=1.5in]{lithium.png} %sets the figure width to 1.5in
\end{figure}
\clearpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Captioning a Figure}
Here is a figure, with a caption

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{lithium.png} %scales the figure down to 50% of the original size
\caption{This is Lithium (${}^{6}$Li)}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Labeling a Figure}
Figure \ref{fig:gerbil} shows the automatic numbering of figures (both in the caption, as well as here, in the text of the document itself.

{\bf Your turn: }
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[
  width=0.5\textwidth]{gerbil}
\caption{\label{fig:gerbil}Aww\ldots.}
\end{figure}
\clearpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Placing a Figure}
Figure \ref{fig:gerbil2}, shown below, shows how one can position a figure on a page.

{\bf Your Turn: Try changing the placement of the figure, using the options h, t, b, p, !, and H}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gerbil}
\caption{\label{fig:gerbil2}Aww\ldots.}
\end{figure}

\section{Simple Tables}

A very basic table
\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{lrr}
Item   & Qty & Unit \$ \\
Widget & 1   & 199.99  \\
Gadget & 2   & 399.99  \\
Cable  & 3   & 19.99   \\
\end{tabular}
\bigskip

{\bf Your Turn:}
Try changing the alignment of the columns.

{\bf Your Turn again (after next slide):}
Try adding horizontal and vertical lines to the table.

\section{Lining up using @-expressions}

\begin{tabular}{r@{.}l} \hline
  3   & 14159 \\
  16  & 2     \\
  123 & 456   \\  \hline
\end{tabular}
\bigskip

{\bf Your turn:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What happens if you change the alignment for the two columns from right, left to left, right? 
\item Try changing the content of the @-expression from a decimal point to something else
\end{enumerate}
\clearpage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \section{multicolumn  and multirow}


\begin{tabular}{|l|l|r|} \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Item} & \multirow{2}{*}{Price (\$)}\\ \cline{1-2}
  Animal & Description &  \\ \hline
  Gnat  & per gram & 13.65 \\
        & each     &  0.01 \\
  Gnu   & stuffed  & 92.50 \\
  Emu   & stuffed  & 33.33 \\
  Armadillo & frozen & 8.99 \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
  
 \bigskip
  
{\bf Your turn:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item What happens if you change Gnat to %${\backslash}$multirow\{2\}\{*\}\{Gnat\}?
 % \multirow{2}{*}{Gnat}
\item What happens if you replace the cline 1-2 command with an hline command?  
\end{enumerate}
\clearpage

 \section{Positioning, Captioning, and Labeling a Table}

\begin{table}[b]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|r|} \hline
  \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Item} & \multirow{2}{*}{Price (\$)}\\ \cline{1-2}
  Animal & Description &  \\ \hline
  Gnat  & per gram & 13.65 \\
        & each     &  0.01 \\
  Gnu   & stuffed  & 92.50 \\
  Emu   & stuffed  & 33.33 \\
  Armadillo & frozen & 8.99 \\ \hline
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{\label{tab:prices}Wholesale Prices}
 \end{table}
  
 \bigskip
  
{\bf Your turn:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Refer to the table in the text
\item Move the location of the table with the positioning parameter
\end{enumerate}
