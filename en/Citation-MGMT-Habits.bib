abstract={Objective This study determines if a relationship exists between a mother's employment and the activities in which her adolescent children participate after school. Methods The author uses panel data from the 1996 Survey of Income and Program Participation with logit and fixed-effects logit models to estimate this relationship. Results Fixed-effects models suggest a positive relationship between maternal employment and participation in lessons after school for the adolescent children of married women and also for those with at least a high school education. Maternal employment is also positively related to sports participation for the adolescent children of unmarried mothers. Conclusions First, this article shows the importance of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in inquiries into the links between maternal employment and adolescent outcomes. Second, it suggests that high-socioeconomic-status mothers may use after-school activities, particularly lessons, as a form of after-school care, while unmarried mothers may use sports.

@article{Plagiarism2007,
abstract = {In this age of information technology, the Internet has brought tremendous changes to the academic and research world. The Internet has had a dramatic effect on the way information is created, organized, ac- cessed, and disseminated. Information can now be accessed easily through databases, the Internet, electronic lists, and various other formats. I In the academic world, though academic dishonesty is not a new phenomenon, it is widely acknowledged that access to online information has made it easier and more tempting to copy or quote another persons original work without attribution. Research indicates that culture and lan- guage barriers play a role, as well. In light of this, many academic institutions have re- sponded to this threat by developing integrity policies that typically use punitive methods to discourage cheating, plagiarism, and other forms of misconduct,1 but plagiarism is still widespread at most institutions. How can these communities acquire proper writing and research skills to enable them to avoid plagiarism? What can librar- ians do to encourage ethical use of informa- tion within the communities they serve? Is information literacy the answer, or is it the responsibility of each individual to respect intellectual property? This article will discuss what plagiarism is and illustrate ways librarians at the University of Tennessee (UT) have promoted the ethical use of information in the university communi- ty. The international/intercultural perspective on plagiarism will also be discussed in order to highlight the attributes plagiarism. C\&RL News March 2},

Ten Australian authors were selected at random from top published authors on the Web of Science (Social Science and Humanities) database.

Self-plagiarism was defined for this study as 10\% or more textual re-use of any one previous publication by the author without attribution. The preliminary findings suggest that textual re-use is widespread in academic research, with 60\% of the authors in the sample having committed self-plagiarism in at least one of their published papers in the period 2003-2006.},

It will give an outline of pedagogic issues, and approaches to reducing the problem. A significant deterrent is the practice of running students work through plagiarism detectors, and ensuring that students realise how effectively this can be done. New research indicates that electronic copy detection can also be applied to Chinese text, as is currently done for English and for programming code. We describe one such detector, the Ferret, outlining its application to English text and its potential for use in other domains including Chinese language. We show how the Ferret is based on exploiting underlying characteristics of English word distribution, and that Chinese characters have a similar distribution. The paper concludes by comparing and contrasting man and machine when it comes to identifying copied material, and indicating how their differing memory processes can be harnessed to detect plagiarism.},

abstract = {In growing numbers, scholars are integrating social media tools like blogs, Twitter, and Mendeley into their professional communications. The online, public nature of these tools exposes and reifies scholarly processes once hidden and ephemeral. Metrics based on this activities could inform broader, faster measures of impact, complementing traditional citation metrics. This study explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or "altmetrics", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of Science.   We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5\% of sampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80\% have been included in at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity; a quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources. Correlation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete picture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that suggest five different impact "flavors", capturing impacts of different types on different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and saved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more research into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.},
